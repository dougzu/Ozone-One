# Ozone 1

Ozone 1 is a custom wristwatch I designed and built as a personal project. It’s a small, minimalist quartz watch that brings together a precision-machined case, a handmade dial, and a simple, reliable movement.

I had the case CNC-machined from aluminum by JLCPCB, sourced the internals from Esslinger, and made the dial myself from sheet aluminum and water-transfer decal paper.

This project was mostly about learning and experimentation — I wanted to learn a little about watches and try my hand at building a nice-looking mechanical object from individual components.

## Fabrication & Assembly

- **Case:** Machined from aluminum by JLCPCB. The case was bead-blasted and annodized by JLC as part of the finishing process.  
- **Dial:** Cut from sheet aluminum I found at Home Depot, and prepared by hand. The process included cleaning, sanding, spray-painting, sanding again, re-coating, and then applying the water-transfer decals before finishing with a clear coat. 
- **Internals:** Quartz movement, stem, crown, and hands sourced from Esslinger. There is also an FDM-printed retention piece that presses the dial forwards, keeping it secure.
- **Assembly:** Final watch assembled without any special tools.

## Notes

This watch was a one-off experiment in design, machining, finishing, and assembly. In the future, I'd like to work on a refined version with improved water resistance, a custom watch band, and a more refined body.
