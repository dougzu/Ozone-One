# Ozone 1

Ozone 1 is a small, minimalist quartz watch that brings together a precision-machined case, a handmade dial, and a simple, reliable movement. Ozone 1 was built as a personal project with the primary goal being to learn and experiment. I wanted to learn a little about how watches are built, and try my hand at a mechanical project where form matters just as much as function. Overall, I am pleased with the end result.

I had the case CNC-machined from aluminum by JLCPCB, sourced the internals from Esslinger, and made the dial myself from sheet aluminum and water-transfer decal paper.

## Fabrication & Assembly

The watch can be roughly broken down into the following parts:
- **Front Case and Rear Case:** The case was machined from aluminum by JLCPCB. It was bead-blasted and annodized by JLC as part of the finishing process. I stuck with a "natural" matte color because I wanted a slightly more industrial feel. 
- **Dial:** The dial is cut from sheet aluminum I found at Home Depot. After cutting it, I cleaned, sanded, and spray-painted it white. Once I was happy with the dial, I applied a clear coat and used water-transfer decals to transfer my dial art on to it. 
- **Internals:** The quartz movement, stem, crown, crystal, crystal gasket, and hands were sourced from Esslinger. There is also an FDM-printed retainer that sits between the dial and rear case. When the rear case is screwed in, the retainer pushes the dial forward against the front case, keeping it secure.

There are better ways to make the dial, but this worked reasonably well for me without much effort. I would have purchased a dial blank, but I struggled to find a dial blank that was the right size, didn't have extra cutouts, and would arrive in a reasonable time.

For a dial with additional cutouts, such as to show the date or day of the week, my homemade dial wouldn't work as well. It'd probably be better to buy a dial blank.

The final watch was assembled wihtout any special tools. While I purchased a seconds hand, I ultimately didn't use it on because I was really struggling to get it secured on the movement's post, and didn't want to damage what was already there. I don't need the seconds hand, anyways.

## Notes

This watch was a one-off experiment in design, machining, finishing, and assembly. In the future, I'd like to work on a refined version with improved water resistance, a custom watch band, and a more refined body.
